Notes on Path Navigators and Node Evaluators

There is an evident issue with large entities navigating
This is particularly due to how expensive calculations get on a large AABB
Calling getters for BlockState and FluidState constantly eat up TPS

There might be an option here to optimize the NUMBER of checks being performed
The proposal would be to utilize methods applied by ObserverLib, which has been ported to 1.18.2
Instead of performing structure checks, we would perform checks for possible blockage on navigation

Pending testing
