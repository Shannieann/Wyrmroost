/**
 * Data is data. It <I>could</I> be cleaner to integrate this data inside the registry logic and have the registry
 * object instances hold everything.
 * HOWEVER, I feel that, much like the "Seperate Client from Server" concept, I would like to keep
 * data related shit in its own space. Thus the DataGatherer
 * This is because, when it comes to runtime, the object instances that hold that data will never even be used.
 * Nitpicky, but I don't care its saving someone that little bit of memory to squeeze that one last chrome tab in.
 *
 * Also, this class' package and everything in it IS NOT compiled with the jar, as it is not needed for production.
 * We're just generating jsons, no need to have that delivered.
